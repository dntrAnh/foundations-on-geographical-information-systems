# GIS Integration and Capabilities

GIS (Geographic Information Systems) integrates various data types and provides comprehensive tools for spatial analysis.

## GIS Connects Your Data

With GIS, you can integrate and analyze a wide range of data, including:
- **Reports**: Combine spatial data with textual reports to provide context.
- **Charts**: Visualize data trends and patterns on maps.
- **Photos**: Geotag and analyze locations with photographic evidence.
- **Presentations**: Enhance presentations with spatial data visualization.
- **Timelines**: Correlate spatial data with temporal changes.
- **Sales Data**: Map sales data to identify geographic trends.
- **Customer Data**: Analyze customer distribution and demographics.
- **Staff Data**: Manage and visualize staff locations and movements.

## GIS Datasets

GIS datasets consist of:
- **Points, Lines, Polygons**: Represent different types of spatial features.
- **Real World Locations**: Map and analyze geographic positions.
- **Feature Class Data**: Store and manage collections of related features.

## GIS Layers

GIS layers are visual representations of spatial data. They can display:
- **Feature Class Symbols**: Icons or shapes representing features.
- **Feature Class Colors**: Color coding for different types of features.
- **Feature Class Filters**: Selective display based on specific criteria.

Within an organization, different teams may choose different layers to display based on their specific needs. When a GIS dataset is updated in a feature class, the corresponding GIS layer updates automatically throughout the system.

### Example: Land Records of Linn County

By using GIS layers, teams can efficiently manage and access updated land records and related spatial data.

## Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically from aircraft or satellites. Key aspects include:
- **Pixel Spectral Reflectance**: Each pixel in a raster dataset records the amount of light reflected from the Earth.
- **Infrared Imaging**: Allows documentation and analysis of critical agricultural data.

### Applications of Remote Sensing

- **Predicting Land Types**: Differentiate between water and land.
- **Analyzing Crop Situations**: Assess the health and status of crops.
- **Finding Spectral Matches**: Use GIS to match pixels' spectral reflectance for various analyses.

## LiDAR: Creating 3D Models

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology enables the creation of detailed 3D models. Key points include:
- **How It Works**: LiDAR uses laser pulses to measure distances to the Earth's surface.
- **GIS + LiDAR**: Integrating GIS with LiDAR data allows for the creation of accurate 3D models.
- **3DEP**: The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) supports the collection of high-quality elevation data.

By leveraging LiDAR and remote sensing technologies, GIS can provide detailed and accurate spatial analysis for various applications.
